        Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, that i have never forgotten it:

        <a class="link" href="4.html">the opening line of a poem, he said, is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet’s task is to create the tree from which such a fruit would fall.</a>
