        <div class="book-1">I will tell you what I miss: I miss watching a movie and at<br>
            the end, huge scrolled words come on the screen and say:

            The End.

            I miss finishing a novel and there on the last page, at a<br>
            discrete distance from the last words of the last sentence,

            It was its own thrill. I didn’t ignore them, I read them, even if only silently,<br>
            with a deep sense of feeling: both the feeling of being replete, a feeling of<br>
            satisfaction, and the feeling of loss, the sadness of having finished the book.

            I have never, in my life, read a poem that ended with the words The End.<br>
            Why is that, I wonder. I think perhaps the brevity of poems compared to<br>
            novels makes one feel that there has been no great sustention of energy,
        </div>
        <div class="book-9">
            no marathon worthy of pulling tape across the finish line. And then I found a poem of<br>
            mine that I had carefully written by hand in the sixth grade, and at the bottom of the<br>
            page, in India ink, beautifully apart from the rest of the text, were the words The End.

        Roland Barthes suggests<br>
        there are three ways to finish any piece of writing: the ending will have the<br>
        last word or the ending will be silent or the ending will execute a pirouette,<br>
        do something unexpectedly incongruent. And I realized children very often<br>
        denote the end because it is indeed a great achievement for them to have<br>
        written anything, and they are completely unaware of the number of stories<br>
        and poems that have already been written; they know some, of course, but<br>
        have not yet found out the extent to which they are not the only persons<br>
        residing on the planet.<br>
        And so they sign their poems and stories,<br>
        <a class="linkspecial" href="11.html">like kings.</a><br>
        <br>
        Which is a wonderful thing.
